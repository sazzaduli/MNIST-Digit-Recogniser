## 🗒️ Overview

This repository contains my solution to the [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer) competition hosted on Kaggle. The competition is designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to computer vision using the classic MNIST dataset.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that correctly identifies handwritten digits from images (0–9). The dataset contains tens of thousands of labeled and unlabeled images, and is widely used for benchmarking classification algorithms.

## 📚 Problem Description

- **Task**: Multi-class image classification
- **Dataset**: MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)
- **Input**: 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits
- **Output**: A label (0–9) corresponding to the digit in the image
- **Evaluation Metric**: Categorization accuracy
